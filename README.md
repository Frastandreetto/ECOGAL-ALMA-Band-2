# ECOGAL: ALMA Band 2

üëã Hello! Welcome to my *ECOGAL ALMA Band 2* Repository!

Here you can find some handy python scripts and functions that can be used to analyze and visualize results of the measurements of the *Low Noise Amplifiers* (LNAs in short) tested @ ESO, Garching bei Munchen and @ Cryowaves Lab of INAF-OAS in Bologna.

At the moment the following scripts and procedures are available:

## üìà Report Production
To produce a report for a batch of measurements of the LNAs you need these python scripts:
- ``f_LNA.py``: contains generic functions useful for LNAs; 
- ``f_Report.py``: contains specific functions to produce the LNAs report;
- ``FA_plot_multiple_cascaded.py``: contains specific functions to make nice plots of the measurements of LNAs and chains;
- ``LNA_report_producer.py``: contains the workflow of the report production. 

Then, you can find all the description of the procedure in the ``Report_Production_procedure.pdf``.

ü•ê Enjoy!
